In this post I would like to show how to make post request with `JSON` data using `curl` cli tool.

### Inline JSON

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"xyz","password":"xyz"}' \
https://httpstat.us/200
```

### JSON file

```shell
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d @auth.json \
https://httpstat.us/200
```
